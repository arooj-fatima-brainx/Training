#Interface Segregation Principle - ISP
#This principle states that "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don't use."

class Car
  def open
  end

  def start_engine
  end

   def change_engine
   end
end

class Driver
  def drive
    @car.open
    @car.start_engine
  end
end

class Mechanic
  def do_stuff
    @car.change_engine
  end
end

#As you can see, our Car class has an interface that's used partially by both the Driver and the Mechanic. We can improve our interface like so:

class Car
  def open
  end

  def start_engine
  end
end

class CarInternals
   def change_engine
   end
end

class Driver
  def drive
    @car.open
    @car.start_engine
  end
end

class Mechanic
  def do_stuff
    @car_internals.change_engine
  end
end
